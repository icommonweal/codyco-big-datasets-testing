# codyco-big-datasets-testing

Tests related to CoDyCo (www.codyco.eu) that require big datasets (> 1MB).

In this repository you can include big datasets and related tests. 

In this way we can test CoDyCo software against big datasets 
(for example for estimation or identification problem), without increasing the size 
of repositories that the users need to download.
